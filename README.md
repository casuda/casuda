- 👋 Hi, I’m @casuda
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d printing, collecting ICs, open it and take photos with a microscope from each.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Korean and much more...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a huge IC database with all ICs ever produced to compare it with all manufactures and put all photos in it.

I would like to create a database that contains all electronic components that have ever been produced. It should not be a data sheet archive. A database that can be searched to replace old components with new components of the same or similar values. A photo of the respective component should also be visible, if possible. 
In addition, as I like to open ICs, I would like to show a picture of the inside of each IC to be stored in the database.
