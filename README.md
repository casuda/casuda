- 👋 Hi, I’m @casuda
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d printing, collecting ICs, open it and take photos with a microscope from each.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Korean and much more...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a huge IC database with all ICs ever produced to compare it with all manufactures and put all photos in it.
